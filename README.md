## ReptiViro

An Arduino based Reptile Environment controller. Seperate day and night control of temperature using a under tank heat pad (UTH) and lighting using a 5050 RGB LED strip. LCD display of target surface temperature, current relative humidity, and actual surface temperature.  


## Motivation

I was looking for a better way to maintain the environment for my Leopard Gecko. Reptiles need specific surface temperatures, humidity and light, which differs during day and night.  

## Installation

You will need to install the libraries included in this "Libraries" folder. This is easily done by copying them under the Libraries folder in your Arduino IDE path.   

## Hardware

I am running this on a Arduino Mega 2560 with a 16x2 LCD Keypad for dispay. There isn't any reason you can't get this to run on something smaller and without the keypad.
